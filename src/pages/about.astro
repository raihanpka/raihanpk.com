            My name is Raihan Putra Kirana, but my friends often called me "Peka". 
            I am currently a second-year student majoring in Computer Science at

            My passion for technology has been growing since I was 5 years old and that was when 
            I tried installing some apps on my dad's laptop. From then on, I would often operate 
            my dad's laptop and also started tinkering with other tech stuff. Maybe that's one of my reasons, why 
            I chose this major.
